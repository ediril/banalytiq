# Primary

- Be able to expand any row in "Top Visited Pages" and get a list of IP addresses

- Be able to filter out IPs on the dashboard

- Start a new db file when the current one reaches a certain size (rename existing, create new)

- Track clicked links: internal & external (needs javascript)

- Track data entered to input/search boxes (needs javascript)

- IP filtering

# Secondary
- Add support for ipv6

- Warn when db file is above a certain size

- Delete db after download
    - Merge downloaded db with the local existing db

- Plan for Improved Bot Detection

  Based on my research, here's why client-side analytics shows fewer visits and what we can implement:

  Current Issues:

  1. banalytiq.php only filters static files, records ALL traffic including bots
  2. index.php has bot detection but only for dashboard display, not recording
  3. Client-side analytics inherently filters bots because most don't execute JavaScript

  Recommended Improvements:

  1. Move Bot Detection to Recording Layer

  - Extract isBot() function from index.php to a shared location
  - Add bot filtering to record_visit() in banalytiq.php
  - Add option to record bot traffic separately for analysis

  2. Enhanced Bot Detection Patterns

  - Add 2024/2025 AI crawler patterns (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, ChatGPT-User, Meta-ExternalAgent)
  - Add behavioral detection (suspicious IPs, request patterns)
  - Add browser age detection for outdated browsers

  3. Additional Server-Side Filters

  - Request frequency limits per IP
  - Missing/suspicious HTTP headers detection
  - Screen resolution filtering (common bot values)
  - JavaScript capability detection

  4. Configuration Options

  - Separate bot recording vs filtering
  - IP whitelist/blacklist support
  - Configurable detection sensitivity


# Future
- Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) list of bots, spiders and crawlers

- SaaS products that automate website optimization (speed, SEO, image compression, etc.) are rapidly growing. NitroPack, for instance, automates website speed optimization and has over 246,000 customers, showing that niche automation tools can scale quickly to $1 million ARR and beyond

- Trend analysis tool
An app that helps business owners spot emerging trends by tracking data over time. They can track changes in sales, website traffic, customer behavior, and other key metrics to identify patterns and forecast future growth.

- search rankings, performing keyword research, and spotting trends in an industry will be a fantastic idea.

- Heatmap analysis tool
Heatmaps are a great way to visualize how visitors interact with websites, apps, or landing pages. This tool would generate heatmaps that show where users are clicking, scrolling, or spending the most time on a page, optimizing your call-to-action placement.
